# CAP 5625 Programming Assignment
# For this Project We decided to use Python
# Project Overview
This project implements a mini-batch gradient descent algorithm to perform linear regression on a dataset that predicts sales based on advertising budgets for TV, radio, and newspapers. 
The dataset consists of 200 observations, with 3 features (TV, radio, newspaper) and 1 response variable (sales).

# Objective
The goal is to fit a linear regression model using mini-batch gradient descent and analyze how the regression coefficients and cost function evolve over time.
 This outputs the best-fit model parameters, calculates the mean squared error (MSE), and visualizes the learning process with two key plots:
- Cost function over iterations
- Evolution of regression coefficients (intercept, TV, radio, and newspaper) over iterations

## Dependencies

The project uses the following Python libraries:
numpy- for numerical operations and matrix calculations.
pandas- for loading and manipulating the dataset.
matplotlib- for plotting the cost function and coefficient evolution graphs.


# Steps to Run Code
install Pythong libraries, if you haven't already --> access the terminal where you will then cd into the "src" file then by using  this line " python gradient_descent.py "
